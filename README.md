# barnacle-book
I have taken a fully functioning API related to Google Books search engine. I have attached RESTful API as well to refactor a GraphQL API witin the Apollo Server.
A user that likes to read can use this search engine to find more books.
The user can also safekeep the list of books they plan to purchase.
When a user inputs the text to search for a book, there is a submit button that can be clicked.
When the submit button is clicked, it will redirect the user to a page that presents the book title and author.
When the user clicks the log out button, they will be logged out.
